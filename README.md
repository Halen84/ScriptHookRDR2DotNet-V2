Community Script Hook RDR2 .NET
============================

**THIS IS A PRE RELEASE BUILD, USE HOW YOU WANT TO! EXPECT ERRORS, CRASHES, ETC**

This is an ASI plugin for Red Dead Redemption 2, ported from [**ScriptHookVDotNet**](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/), based on the C++ ScriptHook by Alexander Blade, which allows running scripts written in any .NET language in-game.

The issues page should be primarily used for bug reports and enhancement ideas. Questions related to RDR2 scripting in general are better off in forums dedicated to this purpose, like [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2) or [gtaforums.com](https://gtaforums.com/forum/459-modding/).

## Known Issues
* Returning pointers causes crash.
* (sometimes) Passing strings through native causes crash (conversion from const char** pointer to string)
